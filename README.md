ArrayLinearList creates a circular array that can store various types of data. Elements can be stored at the front and back of the list. This implements the LinearListADT interface. As an example of adding to the list, if there are elements at position 0 and 1 in an array of size 10, the method addLast adds the element to position 2 and the method addFirst adds the element to position 9.
